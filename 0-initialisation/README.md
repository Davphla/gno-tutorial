## Prerequisities

- Basic programming knowledge
- Familiarity with Blockchain / Web3 concepts

---
<!--
Gno.land is a Layer 1 blockchain that enables the execution of code using the Gno programming language, based on Go language.

Every code deployed on the chain is readable and open source, including comments. It use an interpreted variation of the Go programming language, running on GnoVM.
Using GnoT, the currency of the blockchain, we can interact with it.

## What is Gno.Land ?
- Layer 1 Blockchain
- Gno language (interpreted Go variant)
- Open-source and readable smart contracts
- Based on two components:
    **Realms** = Smart Contracts
    **Packages** = Shared Libraries
- Native token: **GnoT**

## Go Environment Setup

If Go isn’t already configured, add this to your shell config (.bashrc, .zshrc, etc.):
```
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
```
💡 Then restart your shell or run:
```
source path/to/shell_config
```

<!--
Exemple of the counter application :
- Realm code
- Deploy in local using gnodev 
- gno.mod
- Gnoweb interface + actions
- Test the contract
= Show result on gnoweb

# Side note
You can test gno easily using the playground
